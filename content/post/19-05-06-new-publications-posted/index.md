New publications from our research group are out

<!--more-->

Good news from our team. Our recent work has been accepted for publication in three relevant journals. The first investigation, leaded by Dr. Carrillo and published in Frontiers in Neuroscience journal, presents an algorithm for evaluating quantitatively the level of compatibility/interference amongst a set of given cerebellar states according to their representation (granule-cell activation patterns). The second research has been conducted by Dr. Luque in collaboration with the [Dr. Angelo Arleo's group](http://www.aging-vision-action.fr/) in Paris and published in PLoS Computational Biology journal. This article studies the role that the characteristic firing patterns of the cerebellar Purkinje cells play in vestibulo-ocular reflex adaptation.Finally, in a parallel article conducted by Dr. Naveros in collaboration with the Vision Institute, they present a cerebellum-based control loop for real-time control of the eye movements in the iCub robot. This paper has been published in IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics.   

You can find more details about these and other publications from our group in the [publications section](/publication) of this website. Congratulations to all the involved members for your excellent work!!

abstract: "This work presents a flexible reconfigurable approach to a bioinspired spiking neuron. The main objective of this contribution is to evaluate the silicon cost of the implementation of lime-dependent conductances in spiking neurons. The design presented here has been defined using a high level Hardware Description Language (HDL). This facilitates the extraction of simulation results, and the easy change of the circuit. The paper discusses how different aspects of lime-dependent conductances can be particularized in the circuit, and Iheir hardware requirements."

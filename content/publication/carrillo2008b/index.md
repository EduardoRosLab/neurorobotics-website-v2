abstract = "Around half of the neurons of a human brain are granule cells (approximately 1011granule neurons) [Kandel, E.R., Schwartz, J.H., Jessell, T.M., 2000. Principles of Neural Science. McGraw-Hill Professional Publishing, New York]. In order to study in detail the functional role of the intrinsic features of this cell we have developed a pre-compiled behavioural model based on the simplified granule-cell model of Bezzi et al. [Bezzi, M., Nieus, T., Arleo, A., D'Angelo, E., Coenen, O.J.-M.D., 2004. Information transfer at the mossy fiber-granule cell synapse of the cerebellum. 34th Annual Meeting. Society for Neuroscience, San Diego, CA, USA]. We can use an efficient event-driven simulation scheme based on lookup tables (EDLUT) [Ros, E., Carrillo, R.R., Ortigosa, E.M., Barbour, B., Ags, R., 2006. Event-driven simulation scheme for spiking neural networks using lookup tables to characterize neuronal dynamics. Neural Computation 18 (12), 2959-2993]. For this purpose it is necessary to compile into tables the data obtained through a massive numerical calculation of the simplified cell model. This allows network simulations requiring minimal numerical calculation. There are three major features that are considered functionally relevant in the simplified granule cell model: bursting, subthreshold oscillations and resonance. In this work we describe how the cell model is compiled into tables keeping these key properties of the neuron model."

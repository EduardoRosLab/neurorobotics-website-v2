abstract: "This work evaluates the capability of a spiking cerebellar model embedded in different loop architectures (recurrent, forward, and forward&recurrent) to control a robotic arm (three degrees of freedom) using a biologically-inspired approach. The implemented spiking network relies on synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation and long-term depression) to adapt and cope with perturbations in the manipulation scenario: changes in dynamics and kinematics of the simulated robot. Furthermore, the effect of several degrees of noise in the cerebellar input pathway (mossy fibers) was assessed depending on the employed control architecture. The implemented cerebellar model managed to adapt in the three control architectures to different dynamics and kinematics providing corrective actions for more accurate movements. According to the obtained results, coupling both control architectures (forward&recurrent) provides benefits of the two of them and leads to a higher robustness against noise."

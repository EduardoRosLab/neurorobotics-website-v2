I am a senior postdoctoral researcher with the [Computer Vision and Robotics Lab](http://www.ugr.es/~cvrlab/) of the University of Granada. My work has focused on real-time low-latency hardware implementations of computer vision methods such as motion estimation, depth, or visual attention applied to advanced driving assistance systems.

During the last years as a Marie Curie IOF Fellow at the University of Maryland I worked on novel strategies for 3D reconstruction, segmentation, or motion analyisis not only using conventional sensors but rather biologically inspired asynchronous frame-free sensors. I am currently interested in smart sensors and IoT, robotics and manipulation, autonomous navigation, and machine-learning applications for behavioural analysis in video-surveillance and Smart Health.

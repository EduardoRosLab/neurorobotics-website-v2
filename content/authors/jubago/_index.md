I received my B.S in Physics and a M.S. in Data Science and Computer Engineering from the University of Granada (Spain) in 2021 and 2022, respectively. My interest in Neuroscience started with my final degree project and a Department Collaboration Grant, which focused on the development of a spiking neural network based on hippocampal circuits in order to study learning and memory in a spatial navigation task.

Curiosity and the desire to understand how nature works have led me to study physics at the highest level. As well as unravelling the most complex system known to date, which is our brain, the basis of our existence. From the moment I realised that one of the main problems facing humanity is mental health, I wanted to contribute to the understanding of our brain as well as to guide the biotechnological revolution that is taking place.

I am currently working on the neural mechanisms involved in ageing in the cerebellum and their relation in the realisation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex.

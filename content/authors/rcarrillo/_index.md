Richard R. Carrillo is a postodoctoral fellow in the Research Center for Information and Communications Technologies of the University of Granada (CITIC-UGR). His research interests include computational neuroscience and efficient network-simulation methods, with a main focus on real-time simulation of biologically-inspired neural networks and its application to robot control.

More specifically, he has conducted research on event-driven simulation schemes, cerebellar modeling and plasticity, network synchronicity, control of robotic arm trajectory and neural modeling.

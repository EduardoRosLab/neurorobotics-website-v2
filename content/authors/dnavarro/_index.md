I graduated from Computer Science in 2021 and got a Masters Degree in Data Science in 2022, both at University of Granada. At the beginning of my Masters Degree I joined the Applied Computational Neuroscience (ACN) Group to work on the IMOCO4.E project, applying data science techniques to collaborative robotics.

I am interested in machine learning and motor control in robotics. Currently I am working on the development and application of datasets for dynamic modeling of light collaborative robotic arms. These datasets allow us to train and validate machine learning models in order to improve both precision and compliance of the collaborative robots.

I received my M.S in Telecomunication Engineering from the University of Granada (UGR), Spain in 2011. In December 2011 I officially joined to the UGR with a National Grant as a researcher of the European Project TOMSY. I also received my M.S. in Computer Architecture and Networks from the UGR in 2012. Finally, I received my Doctorate from the UGR in 2017 in Computational neuroscience. I am currently now an associate professor in the Department of Computer Systems Architecture and Technology at the Polytechnic University of Madrid.

From 2012 to 2014, I participated in an EU project related to adaptive learning mechanisms and bio-inspired control REALNET. From 2014 to the 2020, I participated in the Human Brain Project (HBP); a ten-year, large-scale European research initiative whose goal was to better understand the human brain and its diseases and ultimately to emulate its computational capabilities. In 2016 I moved to Dr. Arleo's lab in Paris for a period of six months. In 2020 I obtained a possition as assistant professor in the Polytechnique University of Madrid. In 2021 I moved to the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), in Houston, Texas, US, with a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action (MSCA) global fellowship. After the firsts two years of the project, I returned to the UGR, for a period of one year. In 2024 I returned to my position as assistant professor in the Polytechnic University of Madrid. In 2025 I obtained a position as permanent professor in the Polytechnique University of Madrid

My research interests include the simulation of spiking neural networks in real-time for embodiment experiments. More concretely, I am interested in the cerebellum, a small brain center tightly related with the coordination of movements. Our research group has developed a cerebellar model able to perform embodiment experiments with simulated and real robots in real-time, mimicking the way the brain controls our bodies. This kind of embodiment experiments require from specializes tools able to perform the whole simulation in real-time. During my PhD degree I have been focused in the development of EDLUT, a spiking neural network simulator integrating event-driven and time-driven computation schemes using parallel CPU-GPU co-processing. This simulator has been specially designed to perform embodiment experiments in real-time.

Additionally, during my two year stay at BCM, I also performed multiple experimental studies in mice. Using different Eye Blink Conditioning (EBC) experiments in genetically modified mice, I studied how the cerebellum is able to generate sequences of body movements. Additionally, during this period I also developed Phyllum, an automatics analysis tool for electrophysiological recording in the cerebellum with ultradense probes.
